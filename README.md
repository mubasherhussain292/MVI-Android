## About
This project demonstrates the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architecture pattern in an Android application. MVI helps in managing UI state predictably, ensuring a unidirectional data flow, making the app more scalable and testable.

## Description
The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles, separating concerns into different layers:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI interactions using Jetpack Compose or XML with ViewModels.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources (API, Database, etc.).

This implementation ensures immutability, reactive state management using **StateFlow**, and a structured event-driven approach.

## MVI Architecture in Android

### Features
